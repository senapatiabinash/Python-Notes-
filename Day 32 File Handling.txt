File Handling :
--------------------
	to perform any operation we need information or data 

	to handle data upto yet we worked through variables
						life or scope 		
		. LOCAL VAR 		upto the end of a function 
		. GLOBAL VAR 		upto the end of the program 
	
		if the information is stored inside a local var the life of that information upto the end of that function. 
	
		if the information is stored inside a global var the life of that inforamtion upto the end of the program. 
	
		to provide the life of the information beyond the program we have to deal with file. 
	As the part of programming requirement, we have to store our data permanently for future purpose. 
	For this requirement we should go for files.
	Files are very common permanent storage areas to store our data
		file allocates memory from HD. 
	
		HD is a non valatile memory. 	

		with a file how many types of operation we can perform, 
			. read 	
			. write 
	
	Types of Files:
	There are 2 types of files
	1. Text Files:
		Usually we can use text files to store character data
		eg: abc.txt
	2. Binary Files:
		Usually we can use binary files to store binary data like images,video files, audio files etc...
	Opening a File:
	---------------------
		Before performing any operation (like read or write) on the file,first we have to open that file
		.For this we should use Python's inbuilt function open()
		But at the time of open, we have to specify mode,which represents the purpose of opening file.
	Syntax :
	f = open(filename, mode)
	
	Closing a File:
	--------------------
		After completing our operations on the file,it is highly recommended to close the file.
		For this we have to use close() function.
	Syntax :
	f.close()
	mode :
	----------
	The allowed modes in Python are
	r
	r+
	w
	w+
	a
	a+
	Note: All the above modes are applicable for text files. If the above modes suffixed with 'b' then these represents for binary files.
	Eg: rb,wb,ab,r+b,w+b,a+b,xb

	Once we opend a file and we got file object,we can get various details related to that file by using its properties.
		name -> Name of opened file
		mode -> Mode in which the file is opened
		closed -> Returns boolean value indicates that file is closed or not
		readable()-> Retruns boolean value indicates that whether file is readable or not
		writable() -> Returns boolean value indicates that whether file is writable or not
eg:
f=open("abc.txt",'w') 
print("File Name: ",f.name) 
print("File Mode: ",f.mode) 
print("Is File Readable: ",f.readable()) 
print("Is File Writable: ",f.writable()) 
print("Is File Closed : ",f.closed) 
f.close() 
print("Is File Closed : ",f.closed)

Writing data to text files:
----------------------------------
	We can write character data to the text files by using the following 2 methods.
		write(str)
	writelines(list of lines)
Eg: using write function 

f=open("abcd.txt",'w') 
f.write("litindia\n") 
f.write("jithon\n") 
f.write("python\n") 
print("Data written to the file successfully") 
f.close() 

Eg : using writelines function 

f=open("abcd.txt",'w') 
list=["C Program\n","C++ Program\n","Java Program\n","Python Program"] 
f.writelines(list) 
print("List of lines written to the file successfully") 
f.close()
